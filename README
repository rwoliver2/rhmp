= Rob's Helpful Monkey Patches

The Rob's Helpful Monkey Patches gem (or rhmp for short) is a wacky collection
of classes, overloads, and patches that I've found helpful while programming
in Ruby.  In true Ruby fashion, I have tried to keep the code as concise as
possible and easy to customize via overloads.  I hope some of these shortcuts
and things I've missed from other programming languages will assist you as well.
